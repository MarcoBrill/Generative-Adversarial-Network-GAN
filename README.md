## Overview
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of AI models used for unsupervised learning. They consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator evaluates its authenticity.

This project demonstrates how to train a GAN to generate synthetic images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
